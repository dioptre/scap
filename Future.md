chome headless has a debug - and im interested in forwarding this to my clients - it must contain a video and debugging info - how would i do this? Debug

  Because Chrome is effectively invisible in Headless mode, it might sound tricky to solve an issue. It's possible to debug Headless Chrome in a way that's very similar to headful Chrome.

  Launch Chrome in Headless mode with the --remote-debugging-port command-line flag.

  chrome --headless --remote-debugging-port=0 https://developer.chrome.com/

  This prints a unique WebSocket URL to stdout, for example:

  DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:60926/devtools/browser/b4bd6eaa-b7c8-4319-8212-225097472fd9

⏺ You can forward Chrome's headless debugging info to your clients by:

  1. Capture the DevTools WebSocket URL from Chrome's stdout when launching with --remote-debugging-port=0
  2. Proxy the DevTools Protocol - Create a WebSocket proxy that connects to Chrome's debugging endpoint and forwards messages to your clients
  3. Add video capture - Use the Chrome DevTools Protocol's Page.startScreencast() method to get video frames

  Here's a basic approach:

  import websocket
  import json

  # Connect to Chrome's debug endpoint
  chrome_ws = websocket.create_connection("ws://127.0.0.1:60926/devtools/page/...")

  # Start screencasting
  chrome_ws.send(json.dumps({
      "id": 1,
      "method": "Page.startScreencast",
      "params": {
          "format": "jpeg",
          "quality": 80,
          "maxWidth": 1280,
          "maxHeight": 720
      }
  }))

  # Forward both debug messages and video frames to your clients

  Your existing WebSocket server in src/websocket_server.py could be extended to multiplex both the CEF screen capture data and Chrome debugging info to connected clients.

> if i wanted to send keys and paste back?

⏺ For sending keys and pasting to headless Chrome, use the Chrome DevTools Protocol's input methods:

  # Send keyboard input
  chrome_ws.send(json.dumps({
      "id": 2,
      "method": "Input.dispatchKeyEvent",
      "params": {
          "type": "keyDown",
          "key": "Enter"
      }
  }))

  # Send text (paste equivalent)
  chrome_ws.send(json.dumps({
      "id": 3,
      "method": "Input.insertText",
      "params": {
          "text": "Hello world"
      }
  }))

  # Mouse clicks
  chrome_ws.send(json.dumps({
      "id": 4,
      "method": "Input.dispatchMouseEvent",
      "params": {
          "type": "mousePressed",
          "x": 100,
          "y": 200,
          "button": "left"
      }
  }))

  You could extend your WebSocket server to receive input commands from clients and forward them to Chrome's debugging endpoint, creating a full remote control interface.

> and if i wanted to improve the data compression of the Page.startScreencast ?

⏺ For better compression with Page.startScreencast, you have several options:

  1. Adjust quality parameters:
  "params": {
      "format": "jpeg",
      "quality": 60,  # Lower = more compression
      "maxWidth": 800,  # Reduce resolution
      "maxHeight": 600,
      "everyNthFrame": 2  # Skip frames
  }

  2. Use WebP format (better compression than JPEG):
  "params": {
      "format": "webp",
      "quality": 70
  }

  3. Implement delta compression - Only send changed regions:
  # Compare frames and send only diff data
  previous_frame = None
  current_frame = base64.decode(frame_data)

  if previous_frame:
      diff_regions = compute_diff(previous_frame, current_frame)
      send_only_changed_tiles(diff_regions)

  4. Use your existing tiled approach - Your current CEF implementation in src/tiled_encoder.cpp already does efficient tile-based compression. You could apply similar logic to Chrome
  screencast data by:
    - Receiving full frames from Page.startScreencast
    - Processing them through your existing tile compression system
    - Sending compressed tiles to clients

  This would leverage your existing optimized compression pipeline.

> how hard would it be to extend Page.startScreencast

⏺ You cannot extend Page.startScreencast directly - it's part of Chrome's DevTools Protocol implementation. However, you have several approaches:

  1. Wrap/Intercept the protocol (Easy):
  # Intercept screencast frames and apply your compression
  def handle_screencast_frame(frame_data):
      # Apply your tile compression from tiled_encoder.cpp
      compressed_tiles = your_tile_compression(frame_data)
      send_to_clients(compressed_tiles)

  2. Custom CDP method (Hard):
  - Requires building custom Chromium with modified DevTools Protocol
  - Add new method like Page.startOptimizedScreencast
  - Significant engineering effort

  3. Hybrid approach (Moderate):
  - Use Page.captureScreenshot on-demand instead of screencast
  - Apply your existing compression pipeline
  - More control over timing and quality

  4. Browser extension (Moderate):
  - Create extension that captures frames using Canvas/WebRTC APIs
  - Communicate via Runtime.evaluate to execute compression logic
  - More flexibility but requires extension management

  Recommendation: Stick with option 1 - intercept screencast frames and process them through your existing tiled_encoder.cpp compression system. This gives you the best compression without
  Chrome modifications.
